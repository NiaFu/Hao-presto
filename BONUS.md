# BONUS Features

## 1. Focus Management and ARIA Enhancements for Modal Dialogs

- **Description**: Modal dialogs (e.g., for editing titles and thumbnails) are equipped with ARIA attributes and managed focus to ensure accessibility for keyboard and screen reader users.
- **Justification**: This feature significantly improves the application’s accessibility and usability for visually impaired users.
- **Technical Complexity**: Managed focus and `aria-*` attributes for each dialog, ensuring a seamless experience for assistive technology users.

## 2. Minimalist Interface with Ample White Space

- **Purpose**: The minimalist design approach emphasizes content by eliminating unnecessary visual clutter. Generous white space around slides, buttons, and text boxes makes the interface easier to navigate and visually appealing.
- **Impact**: This style not only gives the app a clean, professional look but also aids in guiding the user’s focus towards interactive elements like buttons and editable content areas.

## 3. Layered Modal Overlays with Soft Shadows

- **Purpose**: The modal overlays, such as for editing titles or changing thumbnails, have been given soft shadowing and rounded corners to achieve a modern, elevated look.
- **Visual Impact**: Shadows help distinguish interactive layers from the main slide content, creating a clear focal point without overwhelming the user. The rounded corners and subtle borders also make the interface feel more welcoming and polished.

## 4. Color-Coded Actions for Intuitive Interaction

- **Purpose**: Key actions (e.g., ‘Delete,’ ‘Add Slide,’ ‘Save’) are color-coded—red for deletion, green for adding new slides, and blue for navigation—to make interactions more intuitive.
- **Impact**: This color-coding aligns with common UI/UX practices where color signifies action type, aiding user comprehension and ensuring smoother interactions with less cognitive load.

# Accessibility (A11Y) Improvements

This document describes the accessibility improvements implemented in the project to make the application more accessible and user-friendly for all users, including those with disabilities.

## 1. Semantic HTML Elements

- **Description**: Used semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to give better structure and improve navigation for screen readers.
- **Benefit**: These tags help screen readers understand the document structure, making it easier for users with visual impairments to navigate.

## 2. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles and Attributes

- **Description**: Implemented ARIA roles (`role="button"`, `role="dialog"`) and attributes (like `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-hidden`) where necessary to enhance context for screen readers.
- **Benefit**: ARIA roles provide additional information that can help assistive technology interpret interactive elements, especially for custom UI components that do not have inherent semantic meaning.

## 3. Keyboard Navigation

- **Description**: Ensured that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible, allowing users to navigate the application without a mouse. Used `tabindex` where appropriate.
- **Benefit**: This approach supports users with limited mobility who rely on keyboard navigation.

## 4. Color Contrast

- **Description**: Verified color contrast ratios between background and text to ensure readability for users with low vision or color blindness. Used accessible color schemes to meet the WCAG 2.1 minimum contrast ratio.
- **Benefit**: Improved readability for visually impaired users and ensured text visibility across different backgrounds.

## 5. Focus Management

- **Description**: Managed focus on modal dialogs by setting focus to the first actionable item within the dialog when it opens and returning focus to the trigger element upon closing.
- **Benefit**: This practice provides a smoother and more intuitive experience for users navigating via keyboard or screen readers.

## 6. Alternative Text for Images

- **Description**: Provided `alt` attributes for images and icons to describe their function or content. For example, buttons with icons have descriptive `aria-labels`.
- **Benefit**: Screen readers use alternative text to describe images to visually impaired users, improving the accessibility of visual content.

## 7. Accessible Form Labels

- **Description**: Included labels for all form fields, and used `aria-describedby` for additional instructions where necessary.
- **Benefit**: Ensures that screen readers can accurately interpret form fields, which is essential for users relying on assistive technologies.

## 8. Dynamic Content Announcements

- **Description**: Implemented ARIA live regions (`aria-live`) to announce updates to dynamic content.
- **Benefit**: Allows screen readers to automatically announce changes, providing real-time feedback without interrupting the user's focus.
